# Linked Lists

This structure is used whenever there are many insertions at the beginning or the end and also, when the want to easily retrieve the first item or the next adjacent one.

There are two types of linked lists:

1. Singly List

2. Double Lists

## Singly List

It is a structure meant to be traversed in a single direction (from left to right). They do have an initial node referred to as "Head", the associated complexity for the search action is of O(n).

## Double List

Alongside a Head,  this structure we also has a Tail directing to the end of the collection an d also, each node points to the previous one. Therefore, we do have another action in this structure which returns the last element of the collection and we can now traverse in a reverse direction.
