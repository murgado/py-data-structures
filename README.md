This is a Python project aimed towards remembering all of the data structures commonly used in the implementation of problem solving algorithms, along with the scheme of such structures, this document provides a table in which the time complexity of the most common operations are stated.

## Contents

As per the the characteristics of each structure, these topics are distributed between linear and non linear structures, considering whether they follow a hierarchy or not, in other words, we can not traverse through them sequentially in a single run. 

1. Linear data structures
   1. Arrays
   2. Linked lists
      1. Simple
      2. Double
   3. Stacks
   4. Queues
   5. Set
   6. Map
2. Non-linear data structures
   1. Trees
      1. Hierarchical tree
      2. Binary Search Tree (BST)
         1. In-order traversal
         2. Pre-order traversal
         3. Post-order traversal
   2. Graph
      1. Directed
      2. Non-directed

Hopefully, this will help you the same way it helped me, alongside each data structure you will also find an empty template for you to fill.
