This is a Python project aimed towards remembering all of the data structures commonly used in the implementation of problem solving algorithms, each structure will display not only the resultant scheme written in a Python file, but a Jupyter notebook in which every function is explained using a friendly approach.

## Contents

As per the the characteristics of each structure, these topics are distributed between linear and non linear structures, considering whether they follow a hierarchy or not, in other words, we can not traverse through them sequentially in a single run. 

1. Linear data structures
   1. Arrays
   2. Linked lists
      1. Simple
      2. Double
   3. Stacks
   4. Queues
   5. Set
   6. Map
2. Non-linear data structures
   1. Trees
      1. Hierarchical tree
      2. Binary Search Tree (BST)
         1. In-order traversal
         2. Pre-order traversal
         3. Post-order traversal
   2. Graph
      1. Directed
      2. Non-directed


## Data Structure's Time Complexity Cheat Sheet

|Structure | Insertion at the beginning  | Insertion in the middle | Insertion at the end | Removal at the beginning  | Removal in the middle | Removal at the end | Search | Traversal
--- | --- | ---|  ---| --- | ---|  ---| --- | ---|
Array | O(n)| O(n)| O(1) (+ size increase)| O(n)| O(n)| O(1) (+ size increase)| O(1) / O (n) | O(n)|
Linked lists | O(1) | O(n)|  O(n)| O(1) | O(n)|  O(n)| O(n) | O(n) |
Stacks | --- | ---|  ---| --- | ---|  ---| --- | ---|

Hopefully, this will help you the same way it helped me, alongside each data structure you will also find an empty template for you to fill.
