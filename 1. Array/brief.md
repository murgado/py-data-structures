# Arrays

This is the most basic data structure within this collection but, at the same time, the most used. 
It is useful to collect items of the same type with or without relation within each other.

Each item is related to a memory reference and given an index to represent its position inside the collection ranging from 0 to infinite. 

There are two types of arrays:

1. Fixed sized array

2. Dynamic sized array

## Fixed sized array

Upon its creation, the number of elements of the collection must be stated, either through the sheer elements of the collection or an integer value that represents how much memory we will reserve.

## Dynamic sized array

In this structure, an initial size is given but, depending on the increase of the structure's occupation (allocated memory), the more the reserved memory is asked.
